# Testing

Testing of **Typo** can be done running Grunt build and then grunt tests.
This will compile the project, set up the test and start a http server for testing.

These tests can be run by loading the entire **Typo** project as a Chrome 
extension and then clicking the **Typo** Testing Harness icon in the browser.
A manifest.json file is included in the project root to make this as easy
as possible.
